Dance is an integrated art form, combining the physical, the artistic, the intellectual and the spiritual in one, and as such is an activity that is beneficial to all aspects of development in young people, as well as enriching their lives out of academic study. Dance education is unique in that its effect on primary and secondary school students cannot be provided through other subjects. For example, dance in primary education can contribute to character building, encouraging students to sense and express beauty. At the same time, teachers must seize the opportunity to appeal to students’ psychological needs via rewarding and appreciation, in order for dance to better exert its positive influence on their growth. Generally speaking, extensive use of dance in primary and secondary education would aid the physical and mental development of children and teens in every constructive way, as it is the ideal method in which students may learn to experience, recognise, understand, and convey the concept of beauty.

Dance can improve fitness and correct bad posture, leading to coordination and grace in one’s movement. Dance training transforms students’ attitudes from passive to assertive, thus training their ability to self-discipline and strengthen willpower. School-aged children are at the stage of life where they are highly curious, active, driven to imitate and perform – traits which can all be fulfilled in a dance lesson. Dance performance requires students to use a high amount of energy, having to practice each move repeatedly, which makes it an activity requiring much hard work, thus, training students’ confidence and motivation to overcome difficulties. Dance also promotes the sense of team pride and honour. Children’s dance classes usually train as a large group initially, then forming set teams during rehearsal and performance. A successful performance is the result of everybody’s work, which gives all involved a sense of team spirit. This sense of team spirit acquired through dance may then be transferred upon the class and the school, perhaps even the culture, the country.

Because of the many educational roles of dance, we have founded the dance group to be one that is suitable for the developmental needs of primary and high school students, and deeply connected with all its aspects. While studying dance, students are also influenced and inspired by music, so it could be said that dance can also be used to explain music. Quoting famous Chinese musician Wu Zuqiang: “In a certain sense, in the art of dance, music is the voice of dance, while dance is the body of music. It is an artistic imagination’s product of perfection.”
