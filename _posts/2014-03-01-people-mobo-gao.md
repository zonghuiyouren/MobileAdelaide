Gao Mobo (Honorary dean、language and culture consultant) 
Professor Gao currently teaches Chinese at the Center for Asian Studies at the University of Adelaide, and dean of the University’s Confucius Institute.
Professor Gao studied in the UK, where he worked for eight years, and later worked at Griffith University in Queensland and taught at the University of Tasmania. In 2008 he was appointed Professor of Chinese Studies at the University of Adelaide.
His English books include: "Gao Village," "Mandarin Chinese: An Introduction", "A Reference to Mandarin Chinese", and "The Battle for China's Past: Mao and the Cultural Revolution". In particular, the books "Gao Village" and "The Battle" led him to become a renowned scholar worldwide.
Gao said on academic success that "success is but an experience", that he never considered if the path he had taken has reached the goal of success, and that as long as one does the things they want to do, it is enough. He never did research to catch the trend or for the sake of research. He even said modestly that his luck was good, that he came across opportunities as well as grasped them. Now, Gao just thinks that the time he has is not enough, as there are many plans to carry out, which need time and energy to be invested.
As dean of the Confucius Institute, Professor Gao put a lot of effort into the promotion of the Chinese language and cultural exchange in South Australia.
Professor Gao’s position in the group is of no relation to his position at his current workplace, and was in accordance with his own will.
