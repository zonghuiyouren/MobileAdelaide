The Dynamism Contemporary Folk Orchestra is a Chinese-Western fusion ensemble combining Chinese traditional musical instruments and standard modern orchestral instruments, founded in February 2014. It is Adelaide’s youngest, largest, most complete contemporary folk musical ensemble. Our members are experienced hobbyists from all walks of life, including students, makeup artists, company directors and accountants, brought together by a mutual love of music. The orchestra has been known for its unique originality, the symphonic characteristics of repertoire choice, and high level of proficiency since its establishment. Most notably, the ensemble fuses local musical culture, Chinese traditional music, as well as sounds from different eras, regions and styles around the world, which serves as a dazzling proof of the musicians’ capability. Orchestra members utilise rest time to compose and rehearse a range of new works drawing strong influences from the local cultural, social and artistic atmosphere that shine through their superb performance techniques, and of course, their tireless pursuit for musical excellency.

The orchestra’s aims are to promote folk music culture and to explore contemporary music composition. The orchestra’s future plans include continued rehearsal of classical and contemporary works by Chinese and Western composers, while members will also write new pieces in which they present brave ideas and individual expression, combining elements of traditional Chinese culture, folk culture and a global vision in the context of composition, restructuring the modern perspective of unification of multiculturalism. Composition techniques are inventively modified and innovated from the traditional chamber music format, breaking the barriers between the traditional and the modern, the elegant and the down-to-earth, the east and the west. The musical styles of minority ethnic groups, folk art and contemporary sounds are combined perfectly in rich expressions of cultural character.
