The founder Q.M. Zhou is a professional dancer and choreographer. Under the influence of the dance coach she had who is her mother, Zhou received systematic professional training as a child, in styles including classical Chinese dance, Chinese folk and ethnic dance, and ballet. Zhou has majored in ballroom dancing at the Beijing Dance Academy, studied contemporary dance at TAFE SA, and is a prolific choreographer in Adelaide’s Chinese community holding dual degrees in dance.

During the past decade or so in my learning, I have given most of my time and energy to my dance career. I knew that there comes a time where I must pay back. My mother has supported me on my way throughout this journey, allowing me to navigate the field of dance with ease. I have received countless awards in various dance competitions, in which most of my performances were choreographed by my mother. I earned valuable teaching and stage experience during my time participating in Chinese style dance performance and choreography. When I was on the stage, whether I was performing a self-written routine or other people’s work, my mother always required that I face the task with utmost passion, not allowing me to commit even the slightest error. 

If my study of dance in China can be counted as accumulation of experience, then my studies here in the capital city of South Australia would be improvement of practice. Moving from Chinese traditional dance to contemporary Western dance offered me the opportunity for a giant leap in my dance career. Through my transition from the Chinese traditional system of education to a much more liberal, self-directed education format, I gradually learnt to regulate my ability to adjust. And through the clashes between the differing dance cultures of Australia and China, I learnt of each of their most treasurable essences, witnessing first-hand the brilliance of each country’s artistic vocabulary. This provided me with abundant information to further cultural exchange between the two nations in future, and also gave me a solid foundation for later work.

I am an easy-going, cheerful and generous person. To be modest and a good listener, and to learn and grow is my motto. Outside of work, I enjoy chatting with my friends over a coffee or a meal. Of course, in multicultural Australia, I have friends from a variety of cultural backgrounds, since I like to make friends from different work environments and upbringings, and see it as a way of learning. Although I have lived in Adelaide for over a decade, I have always upheld my career and personal ethos, “three nos, three yeses” form my basic principles:
<ul>
	<li>I will NOT give up my dedication and passion for dance due to changes in my environment.</li>
	<li>I will NOT give up determination to achieve my dreams because of temporary difficulties.</li>
	<li>I will NOT give up my faith and confidence in my goals because of setbacks from failure.</li>
	<li>I am honest in my approaches towards others, and will cut off relations with those who have no morals, or are habitual liars.</li>
	<li>I am a trustworthy person, who would always face my friends with a tolerant and respectful attitude, while people who are cunning and selfish will never be in my circle of friends.</li>
	<li>I understand the importance of being thankful; I am thankful for that my parents have raised me and that my family have always supported me, thankful for all of my friends who have helped me in the past and present.</li>
</ul>

Since my mother was performing on stage while pregnant with a three-month-old me, fate has decided that I live to dance! To me, dance isn’t as simple as just moving my arms and legs, or repeating cycles of work, performance and skills training. Dance is the driving force of life flowing in my blood, the hardship and determination all along my road to today, the sheer happiness of producing a successful piece of work after gathering experience from having choreographed countless failed works. Dance is my eternal thanks to my mother for what she gave to me and my career, my endless memories of my father, the definitive positioning of my future career target!

Once again, I would like to give thanks to my mother for fostering my career as a dance artist, to my father for encouraging me to be an all-rounded high achiever, to all of my teachers who had mentored me, to all of my friends who have given me their help and support.
